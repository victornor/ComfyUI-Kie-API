# ComfyUI KIE API Nodes

## Project overview
A set of ComfyUI custom nodes that connect to the Kie.ai API for image and video generation workflows.

## Why this exists
ComfyUI users often need consistent, API-backed nodes that map directly to model capabilities and work reliably in production workflows. This pack focuses on clear inputs, predictable outputs, and practical integration.

### Supporting Development

This project is built for the ComfyUI community and maintained in personal time.

If you find the nodes useful and are already planning to use **Kie.ai**, using the link below is one way to support continued development and improvements. There is no obligation, and everything works the same regardless.

👉 [https://kie.ai](https://kie.ai?ref=e7565cf24a7fad4586341a87eaf21e42)

## What’s included
- Image generation nodes
- Image-to-video and text-to-video nodes
- Utility helpers for grid slicing and prompt parsing

Node-specific documentation is available in `web/docs`.

## API Key Setup

To use these nodes, you must provide your own Kie.ai API key.

**Steps:**
- Open `config/kie_key.example.txt`
- Paste your Kie.ai API key into the file
- Save the file as `kie_key.txt` in the same `config/` directory

**Important:**  
Do **NOT** share your API key or commit it to version control.

## Current Available Nodes

This node pack currently includes the following nodes:

## Image Nodes
- **Nano Banana Pro Image**
  - Image generation node using the Googles Nano Banana Pro model

  - Accepts 1–8 input images via ComfyUI batch.

## Video Nodes
- **Kling 2.6 Image-to-Video**
  - Generates video from a single input image.
  - Uses the Kling 2.6 image-to-video model.
- **Kling 2.5 I2V Pro**

- **Kling 2.6 Motion-Control Image-to-Video**
  - Image-to-video generation with additional motion control parameters.
  - Designed for more directed camera and motion behavior.
- **Kling 3.0 (Video)**
  - Supports single-shot or multi-shot generation.
  - Supports optional first/last frame control and named element references.
  - In multi-shot mode, total duration is computed from shot durations (max 15s).
  - Optional `kling_data` input allows direct execution from preflight-validated payloads.
  - **Experimental / development status:** not production-ready yet.
- **Seedance V1 Pro (Fast) Image-to-Video**  
  Fast image-to-video generation optimized for quick iteration.
- **Seedance 1.5 Pro Image-to-Video, Text-to-Video**  
  Higher-quality image-to-video generation using the Seedance 1.5 Pro model.

## LLM Nodes
- **Gemini (LLM) [Experimental]**
  - Text generation node using Gemini 2.5/3 Pro/Flash chat completions.
  - Supports role selection, media inputs (images/video/audio), optional reasoning output, and Google Search toggle.

## Audio Nodes
- **Suno Music (Basic)**
  - Minimal inputs: title, style, prompt, model, instrument, tags, gender.
  - Returns two AUDIO outputs + two cover images via KIE Suno API `generate` + `record-info` polling.
- **Suno Music (Advanced)**
  - Adds style/creative weights to the Basic node.
  - Returns two AUDIO outputs + two cover images via KIE Suno API `generate` + `record-info` polling.

## Utility / Helper Nodes

- **Get Remaining Credits**
  - Return number of credits remaining
  - Useful for verifying that your API key is working
  
- **GridSlice**
  - Splits a grid image (such as 2×2 or 3×3) into individual images for downstream processing.

- **Prompt Grid JSON Parser**
  - Parses structured JSON output (for example, from an LLM) into individual prompt outputs.
  - Designed for multi-image and storyboard-style workflows.
- **System Prompt Selector**
  - Combines a user prompt with a system prompt template from `prompts/`.
  - See [prompts/README.md](prompts/README.md) for creating new templates.
- **Kling Elements + Kling Elements Batch**
  - Build named Kling elements (image/video) and batch them for Kling 3.0 prompts using `@element_name`.
- **Kling 3.0 Preflight**
  - Validates/uploads inputs and returns exact createTask payload JSON without running generation.
  - Outputs `kling_data` for direct chaining into `Kling 3.0 (Video)`.
  - Recommended before using Kling 3.0 generation while the node is in development.

## Included Example Workflows

This repository includes two example workflows intended as both a test bed and a reference for how these nodes can be used together.

---

### 1) Node Pack Test & Reference Workflow
**Kie-AI-Nodes.json**

This workflow includes **all nodes in this pack**, each accompanied by inline notes explaining what the node does and how to use it.

**Recommended first step:**  
Always start by running the **Credits / Account Check** node. This confirms:
- Your Kie.ai API key is installed correctly
- Your account has available credits
- The API is reachable

Once credits are confirmed, you can unmute individual node groups and test them incrementally. This workflow is designed to be a safe environment for validation, learning, and debugging before building custom graphs.

---

### 2) Nano Banana Pro Grid Workflow (Advanced Example)
**Kie-AI-Banana-Pro-Grid.json**

This workflow demonstrates a more advanced use case built around **Nano Banana Pro** and grid-based image generation.

**Overview:**
- An optional *face reference image* and a required *source image* are provided
- A language model analyzes the inputs and generates structured prompts
- These prompts are used to generate a **2×2 or 3×3 grid of images**
- The resulting grid is then sliced into individual images using the Grid Slice node

**About the LLM step:**
- This workflow uses an OpenAI Chat LLM node provided by ComfyUI (not part of this node pack)
- This step incurs its own API cost
- You are free to replace this LLM with any compatible model or remove it entirely

**Why this workflow exists:**
This pattern is useful for:
- Generating multiple prompt variations from a single concept
- Creating image sets for downstream video generation
- Breaking large composite images into reusable individual assets

---

Both workflows are meant as **examples**, not strict requirements.  
Feel free to adapt, simplify, or remix them to fit your own pipelines.

## About Kie.ai
Kie.ai is a unified API and model marketplace for image, video, and audio generation. This project is community-maintained and not affiliated with Kie.ai. Learn more at [https://kie.ai](https://kie.ai?ref=e7565cf24a7fad4586341a87eaf21e42).

## Credits and usage
Kie.ai uses a credit-based model for requests. There is no subscription requirement, and pay-as-you-go usage is supported.

## Debugging and job visibility
You can review request history and results at [https://kie.ai/logs](https://kie.ai/logs). Some models can take longer to finish; the default async timeout is set to 2000s to reduce false failures.

## Sponsorship / Development

This project is developed and maintained with support from **Dreaming Computers**  
[https://dreamingcomputers.com](https://dreamingcomputers.com)

Dreaming Computers is an independent studio exploring AI, creative tooling, and automation-driven workflows. The nodes in this pack are built from practical use cases and ongoing experimentation, and are shared with the community as they evolve.
