# ComfyUI KIE API Workflow — Nano Banana Pro + Nano Banana 2 Comparison

This workflow is built for side-by-side testing of **Nano Banana Pro** and **Nano Banana 2** inside ComfyUI using the Kie.ai API.

It is designed to make model differences easy to evaluate across prompt quality, image fidelity, and grounding behavior in a repeatable setup.
